# ETL Power BI Data Catalog

This project automates the extraction of metadata from Power BI workspaces, including reports and semantic models, and stores it as CSV files in SharePoint, making them readily available for further analysis and reporting.

By enabling data catalog management, this project helps organizations and data professionals better understand and manage their assets in Power BI Service. It enhances data governance, facilitates data discovery and documentation processes, also contributing to improve the teamâ€™s overall data literacy.

The project supports execution in various environments, including Docker, Poetry with Pyenv, or pip for dependency management.
